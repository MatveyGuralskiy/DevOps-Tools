            <h2 id="about">About Docker</h2>
            <p class="window" id="information">
                Docker is a platform that enables developers to automate the deployment<br>of applications inside lightweight, portable containers.<br>
                Containers are a way to package and run applications and their dependencies in a consistent environment.<br>
                Docker is a set of platform as a service (PaaS) products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.<br>
                The service has both free and premium tiers. The software that hosts the containers is called Docker Engine.<br>
                It was first released in 2013 and is developed by Docker, Inc.
            </p><br>
                <h2>Installation</h2>
                <p class="window">To get started with Docker, you need to install Docker on your machine. Follow the installation instructions for your Debian/Ubuntu:</p>
                <pre class="window_code" id="installation"><code>
sudo apt update
sudo apt install apt-transport-https
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker-ce
sudo systemctl status docker
<span>#TO add Docker to sudo permissions use this command and restart bash</span>
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER  
                </code></pre>
                <h2>Hello World</h2>
                <p class="window">
                    Once Docker is installed, you can run your first container.<br>
                    Open a terminal or command prompt and type the following command:</p>
                <pre class="window"><code>docker run hello-world</code></pre>
                <p class="window">
                    This command will download and run a simple "Hello World" container.<br> 
                    It verifies that your Docker installation is working correctly.</p>
                <h2>Main commands in Docker</h2>
                <pre class="window"><code>
docker images                  #To see list of all images
docker ps                      #To see list of working processes
docker ps -a                   #To see list of all processes of docker
docker system prune -a         #Delete everything (Images,Containers,Cache)
docker rm (CONTAINER ID)       #To remove Container
docker rmi (CONTAINER ID)      #To remove Image
docker kill (CONTAINER ID)     #To kill the working process
docker stop (CONTAINER ID)     #To stop the working process
docker pull nginx              #To download Docker Image of nginx
                </code></pre>
                <h2>Building Your Own Image</h2>
                <p class="window">
                    To deploy your applications with Docker, you'll need to create a Docker image. <br>
                    Docker images are a lightweight, standalone, and executable package that includes your application code, runtime, libraries, and system tools.<br>
                    Create a Dockerfile in your project directory with instructions on how to build your image. Here is a basic example:</p>
                <pre class="window"><code># Dockerfile
FROM amazonlinux                                   #Or any other distribution you want
RUN yum -y update && \                             #Update packages and install Webserver
    yum -y install httpd
COPY ./(YOUR HTML).html /var/www/html/index.html   #Copy your file to Docker Container
CMD ["/usr/sbin/httpd", "D", "FOREGROUND"]         #Command to Run it
EXPOSE 80                                          #Open port 80 for Webserver
                </code></pre>
                <p class="window">
                    After you create a Dockerfile copy your html file at the same directory with Dockerfile<br>
                    <br>
                    Now let's create a Docker Image<br>
                    <br> 
                    Build your Docker image using the following command:
                </p>
                <pre class="window"><code>docker build -t (YOUR NAME OF IMAGE):(YOUR TAG) .</code></pre>
                <h2>Running Your Container</h2>
                <p class="window">Once your image is built, you can run a container from it for example from port 8080 on localhost:</p>
                <pre class="window"><code>docker run -it -p 8080:80 (YOUR NAME OF IMAGE):(YOUR TAG)</code></pre>
                <p class="window">This command runs a container on port 8080 on your host to port 80 on the container, and uses the image you built.</p>
                <h2>DockerHub</h2>
                <p class="window">
                    Docker Hub is a cloud-based registry service provided by Docker, Inc.<br> 
                    It serves as a central repository for Docker images, allowing developers to share and distribute their containerized applications easily.<br> 
                    Docker Hub is a fundamental component of the Docker ecosystem, providing a centralized platform for image storage, versioning, and collaboration.<br>
                    <strong>Key Features:</strong><br>
                    Image Hosting: Docker Hub allows users to host and share Docker images.<br>
                    These images serve as pre-packaged, standalone units containing an application and its dependencies.<br>
                    Public and Private Repositories: Users can create both public and private repositories on Docker Hub.<br> 
                    Public repositories are accessible to everyone, while private repositories require authentication.<br>
                    Collaboration: Docker Hub facilitates collaboration by enabling users to collaborate on Docker images through shared repositories.<br> 
                    It supports team workflows and versioning.<br>
                    Automated Builds: Docker Hub supports automated builds, allowing developers to link their GitHub or Bitbucket repositories.<br> 
                    This feature triggers automatic image builds whenever changes are pushed to the linked repositories.<br>
                </p>
                <h2>Log in to Docker Hub from the Command Line:</h2>
                <p class="window">
                    Open a terminal or command prompt.
                    Run the following command and enter your Docker Hub credentials:
                </p>
                <pre class="window"><code>docker login</code></pre>
                <p class="window">
                    Enter your credentials of Docker Hub (login and password or use a token)
                </p>
                <h2>How to Use Docker Hub</h2>
                <p class="window">
                    After you login to your Docker Hub, you can push your Docker Images<br>
                    You also can download your or any other Docker Images from the Docker Hub<br>
                </p>
                <pre class="window"><code>docker push (YOUR NICKNAME OF DOCKERHUB)/(YOUR NAME OF IMAGE):(YOUR TAG)
docker run -it -p (YOUR NICKNAME OF DOCKERHUB)/(YOUR NAME OF IMAGE):(YOUR TAG)</code></pre>
